# WHACK_PIH_Team-7.8

We are addressing the discrepancy between true demand and distribution-based demand. The current model uses distribution-based demand, which is subject to inaccuracy due to lack of internet access. Our solution attempts to solve this by using the Twilio API so that users can text orders in case of lack of internet access. We have also created a companion webapp that creates predictive demand models using past demand data.
